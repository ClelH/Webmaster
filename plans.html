                    <p class="store">Programmable Thermostat
                        Most of the energy used in homes is for heating and cooling. A programmable thermostat allows you to produce just the right amount of heating and cooling for your home. For every 1 degree Fahrenheit you adjust your thermostat, you will use up to up to 3% less energy.
                        Cost/Rebates: A Google Nest, a popular programmable thermostat, costs $130. It costs around $170-190 to install the thermostat, and for doing so, you may be eligible for a credit of up to $50.
                        </p>

                    <p class="store">Weatherize your home
                        Insulate electrical outlets, doors, windows, and other in-home spaces that may let in outside temperatures.
                        Cost/Rebates: The cost of weatherizing homes will depend on the extent of the project and what materials are used. Households with a lower income than 80 percent of the area’s median are eligible to have 100 percent of eligible purchases rebated, up to $14,000. Households in the 80 to 150 percent range of the area’s median income are eligible for rebates of 50 percent of project costs.

                    <p class="store">Solar Panels
                        Install solar panels to significantly reduce your reliance on traditional energy sources, lower your electricity bills, and contribute to a more sustainable environment.
                        Cost/Rebates: Solar panels cost around $27,500 prior to incentives, and around $19,250 after the 30% tax credit for a 1,500 square foot house. That results in an average rate of around $12.80 per square foot of living space (as of 2022). On average, a residential solar system costs $10,290–$20,580 in the U.S.

                        Water filters can reduce the harmful effects of the millions of plastic water bottles Americans purchase every year. A carbon filter also helps with removing contaminants.
                        Cost/Rebates: On average, a whole-house water filtration system costs $850 to $5,400, and an under-sink water filter installation costs between $170 and $580. Water filters are $20 to $100 depending on the type, size, and quality of the item purchased. Rebate opportunities also vary.

                    <p class="store">LED Light Bulbs
                        LED bulbs utilize less energy and are far more environmentally friendly than incandescent light bulbs.
                        Cost/Rebates: 10 watt LED light bulbs (the average wattage) only cost around $10 to purchase and $0.33 per month to run.
